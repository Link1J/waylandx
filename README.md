# waylandx

waylandx is a [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) Compositor for X11.

Wayland may be the next great thing, but it lack features currently on X11. This hopes to allow testing of wayland supported apps on any X11 window manager, as well as allowing the use of X11 tools to debug these apps.

## Installation

### Packages
- xcb-utils-error [(repo)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxcb-errors)

`TO DO!`

## Usage

```
